# Contributing to Hux UI

Thanks for wanting to contribute to Hux UI! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or improving docs, we appreciate your help in making Flutter development a bit more delightful.

## Quick Start

1. **Fork the repo** on [GitHub](https://github.com/zoeglbrt/hux)
2. **Clone your fork**: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hux.git`
3. **Install dependencies**: `flutter pub get`
4. **Run the example**: `cd example && flutter run`
5. **Make your changes** and test them
6. **Submit a PR**

## Development Setup

### Requirements

- **Flutter**: 3.16.0+ 
- **Dart**: 3.0.0+
- **Git**: Any recent version

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/zoeglbrt/hux.git
cd hux

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run tests to make sure everything works
flutter test

# Launch the example app
cd example
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

The example app is your playground—it shows off all the components and lets you test changes quickly.

## What We're Looking For

### 🕵️ Bug Fixes
Found something broken? We'd love a fix! Please include:
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Test case if possible

### ✨ New Components
Want to add a new component? Great! Make sure it:
- Follows the existing design patterns
- Includes proper accessibility features (WCAG AA compliance)
- Has comprehensive documentation
- Works across all supported platforms
- Includes tests

### 📚 Documentation
Documentation improvements are always welcome:
- Fix typos or unclear explanations
- Add examples for complex features
- Improve code comments
- Update the docs site content

### 🎨 Design System
Improvements to the theme system, design tokens, or accessibility features are highly valued.

## Code Standards

### Style Guide

We use `flutter_lints` to keep code consistent:

```bash
# Check for linting issues
flutter analyze

# Format code
dart format .
```

### Component Guidelines

When creating components:

1. **Follow the naming convention**: `HuxComponentName`
2. **Use design tokens**: Access colors via `HuxTokens` and `HuxColors`
3. **Include accessibility**: Proper semantics, contrast ratios, keyboard navigation
4. **Support theming**: Components should work in both light and dark themes
5. **Add documentation**: Include dartdoc comments explaining usage

Example component structure:

```dart
/// A beautiful button component with multiple variants.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// HuxButton(
///   onPressed: () => print('Hello!'),
///   child: Text('Click me'),
///   variant: HuxButtonVariant.primary,
/// )
/// ```
class HuxButton extends StatelessWidget {
  const HuxButton({
    super.key,
    required this.onPressed,
    required this.child,
    this.variant = HuxButtonVariant.primary,
    // ... other params
  });

  // ... implementation
}
```

### Testing

Write tests for your components:

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

We aim for good test coverage, especially for:
- Component behavior
- Accessibility features
- Theme switching
- Edge cases

## Accessibility First

Hux UI is built with accessibility in mind. Every component should:

- Have proper contrast ratios (WCAG AA: 4.5:1 minimum)
- Support keyboard navigation
- Include semantic labels and roles
- Work with screen readers
- Handle focus management correctly

We use automated contrast calculation to ensure text readability across all color combinations.

## Submitting Changes

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: add HuxToggleButton component
fix: resolve contrast calculation edge case  
docs: update HuxCard usage examples
style: format code according to flutter_lints
```
